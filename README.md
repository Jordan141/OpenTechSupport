# OpenTechSupport
Similar to my Customer Support application, except this would be it's own Software-as-a-Service solution.

### Concept

An open platform for technical experts to be reviewed by their peers based on how they handle problems. Similar in employ as support staff,
but they would be paid to answer questions requested of them by their peers. Free to set their own rate (within reason) based on their current standing in the community. Rating would create competition between experts to be as helpful as possible in order to receive the best reviews they can, thus eliminating the toxicity found in other platforms, such as StackOverflow. 

Beginning experts could give their advice and suggestions for free to increase their rating at the start.

You would only pay based on a successfully completed request, unless otherwise agreed.
